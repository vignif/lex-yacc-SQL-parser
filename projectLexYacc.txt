Using lex/yacc implement a parser for the select SQL statement.
The syntax of the command is

select col1, col2,… from tab1, tab2,.. where cond

where the column (col1, col2,…) and table (tab1, tab2,..) names
have the usual structure of identifiers (alphanumeric strings
beginning with a letter) and cond is the condition that
is written by combining terms

col op col
col op const

using the connectors and, or. col is a name of a column, const is a constant
and op is a comparison operator among <, >, =. For instance

select serial, name, salary from employees, salaries where serial = code and
name = john and salary > 1000

In the code just print the matched terms.
